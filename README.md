If you want to run this, follow these instructions (These depend on the git and dotnet cli tools):

Clone this repository to a location of your choice with 
...
git clone https://github.com/MyCatIsHurtingMe/Chess.git

dotnet publish -f net9.0-desktop -o Build -r {TARGET} -p:SelfContained=true -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true -p:IncludeAllContentForSelfExtract=true
...
with {TARGET} replaced with your OS+Architecture combination.
